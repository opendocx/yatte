{[Testator.State]}, being of sound mind, not acting under duress or undue influence,
and fully understanding the nature and extent of all my property and of
this disposition thereof, do hereby make, publish, and declare this

other wills and codicils heretofore made by me.

EXPENSES & TAXES
================

I direct that all my debts, and expenses of my last illness, funeral,
and burial, be paid as soon after my death as may be reasonably
convenient, and I hereby authorize my Personal Representative,
hereinafter appointed, to settle and discharge, in his or her absolute
discretion, any claims made against my estate.

I further direct that my Personal Representative shall pay out of my
estate any and all estate and inheritance taxes payable by reason of my
death in respect of all items included in the computation of such taxes,
whether passing under this Will or otherwise. Said taxes shall be paid
by my Personal Representative as if such taxes were my debts without
recovery of any part of such tax payments from anyone who receives any
item included in such computation.

PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE
=======================

I nominate and appoint {[Representative.Name]}, of {[Representative.City]}, County of {[Representative.County]}, State of {[Representative.State]}
as Personal Representative of my estate and I request that {[Representative.Gender.HeShe]} be
appointed temporary Personal Representative if {[Representative.Gender.HeShe]} applies. {[if NominateBackup]} If
my Personal Representative fails or ceases to so serve, then I nominate
{[BackupRepresentative.Name]} of {[BackupRepresentative.City]}, County of {[BackupRepresentative.County]}, State of {[BackupRepresentative.State]} to serve.{[endif]}

If any of my beneficiaries have pre-deceased me, then any property that
they would have received if they had not pre-deceased me shall be
distributed in equal shares to the remaining beneficiaries.

If any of my property cannot be readily sold and distributed, then it
may be donated to any charitable organization or organizations of my
Personal Representative's choice. If any property cannot be readily sold
or donated, my Personal Representative may, without liability, dispose
of such property as my Personal Representative may deem appropriate. I
authorize my Personal Representative to pay as an administration expense
of my estate the expense of selling, advertising for sale, packing,
shipping, insuring and delivering such property.

intentionally, and not as a result of any mistake or inadvertence,
omitted in this Will to provide for any family members and/or issue of
mine, if any, however defined by law, presently living or hereafter born
or adopted.

No bond shall be required of any fiduciary serving hereunder, whether or
not specifically named in this Will, or if a bond is required by law,
